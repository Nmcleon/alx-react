# React Redux Reducer and Selector Specialization

## Overview

In this specialization, you will work on creating reducers and selectors for managing state in a React Redux application. The tasks cover various aspects such as creating basic reducers, using Immutable.js, normalizing state shape, and implementing selectors for efficient data retrieval.

## Tasks

### Task 0: Write a basic reducer

- Define the initial state of the UI reducer.
- Implement actions to update UI state.
- Write tests to ensure the correctness of the reducer.

### Task 1: Use Immutable for the UI Reducer

- Integrate Immutable.js into the UI reducer.
- Update reducer functions to use Immutable.js Map and set methods.
- Modify tests to accommodate Immutable.js changes.

### Task 2: Create a reducer for Courses

- Define actions and reducers for managing courses.
- Implement actions for selecting and unselecting courses.
- Write tests to validate the behavior of the course reducer.

### Task 3: Create the reducer for notifications

- Define actions and reducers for managing notifications.
- Implement actions for marking notifications as read and filtering notifications.
- Write tests to ensure the correctness of the notification reducer.

### Task 4: Normalizr & Immutable

- Utilize Normalizr to simplify mutation of collections.
- Update reducers to use Immutable.js for state management.
- Adjust tests to validate the updated reducer functionality.

### Task 5: Selectors

- Implement selectors for efficient data retrieval from reducers.
- Write tests to verify the correctness of the selectors.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Follow the instructions provided in each task to complete the implementation.
4. Run tests using `npm test`.

## Repository Structure

- `src/`: Contains source files for reducers, selectors, and other application logic.
- `tests/`: Includes test files for each task.
- `schema/`: Contains schema definitions for normalizing data.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Redux
- Immutable.js
- Normalizr
- Jest (for testing)
